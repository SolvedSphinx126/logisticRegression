This program was tested on Ubuntu (WSL) and Windows with Python 3.10

This program depends on:
    math
    numpy
    pandas

boston.txt is also required to be in the same directory as the source file as shown below:

```
BenObryanHW1/
├── boston.txt
├── linearRegression.py
└── readme.md
```

The command to run this program should be something like 
`<path to python executable> < path to linearRegression.py>`

on Ubuntu this was:
`python3 ./linearRegression.py`

and on Windows this was
`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe C:\Users\<username>\PycharmProjects\linearRegression\linearRegression.py`
